# I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1

Arduino library to support I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1 LoRa® expansion board based on USI®
LoRaWAN™ technology module.

## API

This library provides an Arduino API to manage the I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1 expansion
board as a LoRaWAN™ node.

* You will be able to choose the ABP or OTAA mode and set the corresponding keys.
* Send and receive some data.
* Select the EU or US band.
* Enable or disable the duty cycle (must be enabled in EU band).
* Enable the adaptative data rate and configure the data rate.
* Put the device in sleep mode.

This library provides also an API to manage the I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1 expansion board
as a simple LoRa® radio module.

* Configure the radio parameters (frequency, tx power, spreading factor, band width, ...)
* Send/receive data
* LoRaWAN stack disabled

## Known limitations

* The module supports only class A.
* Sleep mode is not supported in OTAA mode with the version 2.6 of the firmware.
* Important note for Nucleo64:

  By default, D0/D1 of CN9 board connector are respectively not connected to
  PA3 and PA2 (SB62 and SB63 opened).
  Those pins are connected to STLink USART thanks to SB13, SB14.

  To use the shield:
    - Connect shield D0(Tx) to a free U(S)ARTn Rx pin
    - Connect shield D1(Rx) to a free U(S)ARTn Tx pin

  Where 'n' are the same U(S)ART number.

    - Update the Serial instance definition used for LoRa using the chosen Rx/Tx

  or

    - Close SB62 and SB63 to connect D0/D1 of CN9 connector to PA3 and PA2
    - Open SB13 and SB14 to disconnect PA3 and PA2 from STLink UART

  but in this case, you will have to wire STLink Rx/Tx of CN3 connector to
  another pins and update Serial instance before call `Serial.begin(115200);`
  using:
  ```
  Serial.setRx(Rx pin);
  Serial.setTx(Tx pin);
  ```
  
  See [UM1724](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00105823.pdf), §6.8 section for more information.

## Examples

* **getInfo**: display several info about LoRa shield (Firmware version, device EUI,...)
* **LoRaWANABP**: send/receive data in ABP mode.
* **LoRaWANOTAA**: send/receive data in OTAA mode.
* **LoRaPingPong**: P2P exchange in LoRa®.
* **BridgeSerial**: Send/Receive AT command from/to PC terminal to/from shield (console mode).

## Advice

LoRaWAN default configuration:

* Join accept delay is set to 5000 ms (LoRaWAN default value).
* The network type is public by default. Use `setPublicNwkMode()` to set the network
type in private.
* RX1 window delay is 1000 ms by default. Use `setRx1Delay()` to set a new value.

In case of high latency between the gateway and the network server, it is recommended
to increase the delay time of the RX1 window.

## Version

This library is based on the STM32CubeExpansion_LRWAN_V1.1.2 driver.
This library has been validated with the version 2.6 and 3.6 of the firmware.
